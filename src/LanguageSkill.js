        <p>
          My Erasmus stay helped me to bring my language level to another dimension. ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡º I spoke
          everyday in the mothertongue of Grace Hopper and Alan Turing while working with teacher
          and foreign students from all over Europe and further.
        </p>{' '}
        <p>
          It helped me grasping the remaining English's subtilities and using it for in reality.
          Such experience is unmatched in someone's life and so it was for me as well.
        </p>
        <p>It blew my mind and changed forever my vision on the world.</p>
